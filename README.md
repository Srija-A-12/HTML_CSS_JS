# 🚀 Learning 30 Days, 30 Projects — HTML,CSS,Java Script Series

Welcome to my **30 days, 30 projects journey**! 🎉
Each day, I’ll create a small project using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and learn something new.

---

## 📅 Day 1 — 29.08.2025

**Project:** Drag & Drop 👐
**Duration:** \~10 minutes
**Skills Learned:**

* Connecting **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** for the first time
* Using **draggable attribute**
* JavaScript **DOM methods** and **event listeners**
* `dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop` events
* Moving elements dynamically with `appendChild`

**Project Description:**
I created two boxes (`left` and `right`) and added draggable list items. I learned how to drag items from one box to another, and also learned **how to use JS to control the DOM** dynamically.

### ⚡ Quick Emoji Cheat Sheet — JS Methods / Events Used

* 🏷️ `document.getElementsByClassName()` → select all elements with a class
* 🎯 `document.getElementById()` → select a single element with an ID
* ✋ `draggable="true"` → make element draggable
* 🚀 `dragstart` → fires when dragging starts
* 🛬 `dragover` → fires when dragging over a drop zone (must call `e.preventDefault()`)
* 👐 `drop` → fires when you release the dragged element on a drop zone
* 📦 `e` → event object, tells you what happened
* 🎯 `e.target` → the element being dragged
* 🚫 `e.preventDefault()` → allow drop by canceling default behavior
* 👂 `addEventListener()` → attach event handler to element
* 🧺 `appendChild()` → move/attach element into another element
* ✋ `selected` → variable holding the dragged element
* 🔄 `for...of` → loop through all items
