# 📝 Detailed Explanation — HTML & CSS Terms

### `<nav>` 🧭

**Child-friendly:** Like a shelf holding all the buttons (Home, About, etc).
**Technical:** Semantic HTML tag for website navigation.

---

### `class` vs `id` 🆚

* `class` 🏷️ → Many elements can share it (e.g., `.info`, `.logo`)
* `id` 🎯 → Unique, one element only (e.g., `#hero`)

---

### `position: relative / absolute` 📐

**Child-friendly:** “Relative” is the parent staying still, “absolute” is the child floating inside it.
**Technical:** Absolute positioning uses the nearest relative parent as reference.

---

### `flexbox` 🧩

**Child-friendly:** Like arranging toys neatly in a row.
**Technical:** CSS layout model for aligning items easily.

---

### `hover` ✨

**Child-friendly:** When you wave your hand (mouse) over something, it reacts.
**Technical:** CSS pseudo-class triggered when hovering over an element.

---

### `transition` 🎬

**Child-friendly:** Makes changes smooth, not jumpy.
**Technical:** CSS property that controls speed of hover effects.

---

### `font-family` 📝

**Child-friendly:** The handwriting style of the text.
**Technical:** CSS property to define text style (e.g., sans-serif).
